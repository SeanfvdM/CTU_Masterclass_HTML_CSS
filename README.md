## Connect an SQL database

The only article I could find with good information was [how to connect sql server database from javascript in the browser](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-connect-sql-server-database-from-javascript-in-the-browser/) which explains how to host a local server that connects to the database, essentially a REST server.

A lot of articles go into PHP which I have not used so I sadly can't recommend any of those articles.
